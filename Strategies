POWER AND SENSE MANAGEMENT 

We have a total of 5 sensors. At the front, The camera supports detecting 
obstacles for the red and green blocks. Both sides of the robot have V2 
sensors that detect and avoid barriers, these sensors ensure smooth movement
 and prevent collisions. The bottom of the car has an integrated grayscale
 module. This module is responsible for accurately identifying different
 scales, particularly the blue and orange scales. Additionally, Turning its
 direction of the obstacle. Lastly, To provide clear visual feedback, a 
full-color light module is strategically placed at the back of the robot. 
This module serves as an effective indication system. Allowing operators to 
easily monitor the robot's status and respond accordingly. Together, 
these sensors work effectively to conduct a good robot's performance.

MOBILITY 

In our robot it consists of 2 motors, a 2 pin motor called Ordinary motor
and a steering servo motor. The motor has an rpm of 200RPM±10%, the working
voltage is 7.4V, the reduction ratio is 1:120, the no-load current is 50 mA,
and it's compatible with the LEGO construction system. The Servo motor or the 
Simulated Steering Gear Module The working voltage is 5V, the torque is 1.5kgf
cm, the angle range is 0~180°, and the speed is 0.12 seconds/60°; the shell
is also compatible with the LEGO construction system.
